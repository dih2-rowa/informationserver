*The whole picture shows the scope of the entire Robosonic project. The red square shows the components of the Information Server.*

Basically, the Information Server consists of 3 software components:
  - Operator Information Server
  - Web Server
  - GUI

### Operator Information Server
  The Operator Information Server is written in python and with the use of the library Flask.
  The API reads the data from the CrateDB and returns it to the Web-Client if the data is requested. To access CrateDB the library SQLAlchemy is used. But only the version 1.3 or lower supports CrateDB.


### Web Server

### GUI
  The graphical user interface is written with the Angular-framework. This allows to write the website a reusable way. The website is designed with HTML and SCSS. Typescript is used to request the data from the api and parse it down to the HTML-template.
